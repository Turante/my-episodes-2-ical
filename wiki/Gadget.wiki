===Switch feed types===
Select the 'menu' icon in the lower right of the gadget to choose from the available feed types. Switching the feed causes the gadget to refresh (it does not refresh Google Calendar though) and displays the selected feed.

From this menu you are also able to view the raw XML from !MyEpisodes.com by clicking the 'View Feed XML' menu item. This will view the raw XML for the currently selected feed. If you wish to view the raw XML of a different feed, select that feed first before selecting the 'View Feed XML' menu item.

You can also log out of the gadget which sends you back to the [Gadget#Login_View login screen].
